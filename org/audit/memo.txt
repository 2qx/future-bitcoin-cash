Future Bitcoin Cash Audit

2024-04-26  2qx to BCA

This is a memorandum of understanding between 2qx, ("Client") and bitcoincashautist (a.k.a. BCA, "the Auditor") for a review and written audit report of "Future Bitcoin Cash" contracts.

The Client proposes the audit will proceed in two phases. 

First, and initial assessment will be given of potential flaws or mistakes in the workflow or logic of the contract system. Second, once the Client has revised the contracts with improvements and corrections, the Auditor may prepare a written report on the security of the contracts.

The scope of the report should address near and long term security concerns, but may be limited to the on-chain operation of the permanent contracts. The report may omit any consideration of one-time use bootstrapping contracts (i.e. the Battery). The report should address post-quantum and quantum-resistant concerns of the double-sha256 script locking mechanisms on the long term viability of the system. The report should note any potential for DDoS or other network attack vectors. 

The Auditor's report must be submitted in markdown format to be hosted by the Client in the final app. 

The Auditor's fee will be conveyed in Future Bitcoin fungible tokens. The fee will be conveyed as 2 FBCH UTXOs from each of the premiere vaults of the five timescale tranches, a total of 10 FBCH. To prevent the Client from the unsavory misfortune of holding a BCH-pegged liability, the Auditor will custody the 10 BCH necessary for creation of his FBCH tokens between the completion of the audit and the completion of the app. Once the Auditor retrieves his 2 FBCH x 5 from the premiere vaults, those FBCH tokens shall be considered by all parties to be free and unencumbered from any obligations or earmarks, i.e. that Auditor has been fully paid and may degen his Futures at will.

This is a non-binding memorandum of understanding without contingency.
